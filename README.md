# AutoScattering

AutoScattering is an efficient tool to automatically discover coupled mode setups with desired scattering properties, e.g. to realize an isolator, a circulator or an amplifier. Our tool optimises the discrete and continuous properties of the setups and provides an exhaustive list of all possible setups. The user can then select the setups best suited for the hardware.

This repository allows you to design your own coupled mode setups with your desired scattering behaviour and to reproduce the examples discussed in our publication: \
[Automated Discovery of Coupled Mode Setups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14887) \
*Jonas Landgraf, Vittorio Peano, and Florian Marquardt* (2024) 

## Getting started

## Overview over available examples:


## Installation
We recommend create a new environment using venv or conda. The package can be installed with:
```
git clone https://github.com/jlandgr/autoscattering.git
cd autoscattering
python setup.py install
```
